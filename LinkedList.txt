The linked list activity code's goal is to add and remove nodes from the front of the list. To do this, I used
what we learned about linked lists in the text provided and what we learned from before about pushing and popping.
Most of the explanation will be in the video for how the code works. We decided to do a loop that takes in the 
amount of nodes that the user would like to create and the amount of nodes that the user would like to delete. This
activity was interesting and a bit more challenging than the rest because of having to keep track of the different fields
of each node which are the data field and the next field which has an address of the next node. I hadn't worked with
these types of lists before so it was a fun challenge to research it and figure out their strengths and weaknesses.
Speaking of which, the strengths of this type of list is the easy ability to create and delete nodes since it does
not take a linear O(N) time to create or delete nodes and only takes O(1) time for each action or step. However, its
weakness is searching as it does have to go through each node and look at the next address to find the value wanted.
